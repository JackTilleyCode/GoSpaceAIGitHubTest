 INTRODUCTION
------------

The Administration Menu module displays the entire administrative menu tree
(and most local tasks) in a drop-down menu, providing administrators one- or
two-click access to most pages.  Other modules may also add menu links to the
menu using hook_admin_menu_output_alter().

 * For a full description of the module, visit the project page:
   https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_menu

TOOLSET REQUIREMENTS
------------
 * Visual Studio 2019

 
INSTALLATION
------------
 
 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit
   https://www.drupal.org/node/895232/ for further information.

 * You may want to disable Toolbar module, since its output clashes with
   Administration Menu.
